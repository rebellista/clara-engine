## ü§ù Contributor Guide: Join the Clara Movement

Clara Engine is not open source in the traditional sense. It‚Äôs mythic-grade.  
We welcome collaborators who build with emotional clarity, forensic rigor, and symbolic precision.

### üß≠ What You‚Äôre Building Into  
Clara is a real-time dashboard for:
- Livestream annotation and expos√© scripting  
- Deception profiling and persona breakdown  
- Emotional motif tracking and sociological analysis

Modules are plug-and-play. Each one should feel like a cinematic lens.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute  
1. Fork the repo and clone it locally  
2. Build a module (e.g. clothing tracker, charisma profiler, timestamp parser)  
3. Follow the Clara Ethos:
   - Emotional clarity over complexity  
   - Symbolic resonance over raw data  
   - Ethical storytelling over spectacle  
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - A short mythic description of your module  
   - Sample data or demo clips  
   - Notes on emotional, sociological, or symbolic impact

### üß¨ Module Ideas  
You don‚Äôt need permission‚Äîjust precision.  
Here are some modules we‚Äôd love to see:
- Clothing & Image Tracker  
- Charisma Spike Detector  
- Lie Detection Grid  
- Motif Mapper

### üß† Who We Welcome  
- Analysts who decode livestreams like crime scenes  
- Creators who want mythic self-awareness  
- Engineers who build emotional intelligence systems  
- Journalists who script expos√©s with fairness and clarity

### üßπ House Rules  
- No spectacle for spectacle‚Äôs sake  
- No modules that manipulate or mislead  
- No data extraction without ethical framing  
- Every contribution must serve emotional clarity and mythic truth
