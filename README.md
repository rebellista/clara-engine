## 🧬 Clara Engine  
**A mythic-grade forensic dashboard for livestream analysis, deception profiling, and persona mapping.**  
Built for creators, journalists, educators, and analysts who decode digital collapse in real time.

### 🧠 What Clara Is  
Clara is not a tool.  
It’s a lens. A ritual. A system for emotional clarity in the age of spectacle.  
It captures the moment charisma fractures, the instant myth collapses, the timestamp of truth.

### 🔍 Core Capabilities  
- **Deception Profiling**: contradiction loops, microexpressions, charisma spikes  
- **Persona Mapping**: clothing symbolism, tonal pivots, archetypal triggers  
- **Motif Tracking**: emotional beats, symbolic props, audience manipulation tactics  
- **Clip Logging**: timestamped annotation for exposé scripting and documentary storyboarding

### 🛠️ Technical Architecture  
- **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time annotation  
- **Modular system**: plug in deception profilers, clothing trackers, emotional motif parsers  
- **Exportable grids** for publishing engines, exposé workflows, and sociological analysis

### 🎯 Who It’s For  
Clara is designed for:
- **Creators** seeking mythic self-awareness  
- **Journalists** exposing digital manipulation  
- **Educators** teaching emotional intelligence and media literacy  
- **Analysts** decoding livestreams, influencers, and internet folklore

### 🌍 Why It Matters  
In a world of spectacle, Clara offers forensic clarity.  
It’s how we canonize collapse.  
It’s how we build legacy from chaos.
